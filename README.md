# scwPy
(Ab)using the Scaleway-SDK python package to do server management from the comfort of a Python app instead of the god-awful website. 

Simply contains some example usages to demonstrate how to perform some common actions. May in the future turn this into more of a wrapper for common operations to make it less awful to use.
