# scwPy
(Ab)using the Scaleway-SDK python package to do server management from the comfort of a Python app instead of the god-awful website. 

Slowly creating some sort of wrapper around the existing Scaleway.ComputeAPI module, because figuring out the API :arrow_right: Python translation more than once is not something I'm willing to do, and I really wanted it to have Python objects to represent servers and such. 

Vague example useage in `test.py`

# Requires:
https://github.com/scaleway/python-scaleway,
Install with:
```
pip install scaleway-sdk
```
